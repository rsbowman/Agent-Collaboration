Agent Collaboration
===================

This code simulates collaborating robots pushing boxes in a
hypothetical warehouse.  It was used to create data for the paper

R. Sean Bowman and Henry Hexmoor.  Agent Collaboration and Social Networks.  In *Proceedings of Knowledge Intensive Multiagent Systems (KIMAS)*, 2005.

This paper is available in the repo as 'agent-collaboration.pdf' and
should explain most of what the code does.
